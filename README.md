# 📊 Upgrade pgwatch Grafana Dashboards to Grafana v11

This project focuses on upgrading the existing **pgwatch dashboards** to ensure full compatibility with **Grafana v11** by removing deprecated components, refining JSON definitions, and enhancing the overall user experience with new features introduced in v11.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Upgrade dashboards to align with **Grafana v11** standards.
- Replace **deprecated AngularJS-based panels** like `singlestat`, `graph`, and `text (HTML)` with `stat`, `timeseries`, and `markdown`.
- Refactor **JSON panel structures** using `fieldConfig`, `options`, `overrides`, and transformation blocks.
- Improve **user experience** with better layout, visualization modes, tooltips, and selection filters.
- Ensure dashboards are **data-driven and testable** through PostgreSQL simulation.
- Document the migration process to serve as a guide for future dashboard upgrades.

## ✨ Features & Improvements

- ✅ Replaced all deprecated panel types (`singlestat`, `graph`, `text`) with modern v11 equivalents.
- ✅ Cleaned up and restructured JSON using `fieldConfig`, `transformations`, and `overrides`.
- ✅ Added **metadata-based query selection** for dashboards like *Single Query Details*.
- ✅ Introduced **summary panels** sorted by criticality for dashboards like *Health Overview*.
- ✅ Integrated **Grot (Grafana's AI assistant)** into the left panel for contextual help.
- ✅ Ensured **every component receives real data** through PostgreSQL simulation.
- ✅ Documented dashboard upgrade workflow for maintainability and onboarding.

## ⚙️ Approach

### 🧩 Community Bonding
- Understood project scope and v10 → v11 differences.
- Reviewed existing dashboards and identified deprecated components.
- Finalized timeline, deliverables, and feedback loop with mentors.

### 🔍 Milestone 1: AngularJS Detection & Replacement
- Wrote a Python script to scan JSON files and list deprecated components.
- Created a reference table mapping old components to v11 replacements.

### 🧪 Milestone 2: Data Simulation & Testing
- Used PostgreSQL and pgbench to simulate live data for dashboard validation.
- Ensured components like **QPS**, **Tuple operations**, **WAL stats**, and **Query time** graphs were responsive.

### 🛠 Milestone 3: JSON Cleanup & UX Enhancements
- Replaced legacy fields (`yaxes`, `lines`, `fill`) with `fieldConfig` and `options`.
- Added meaningful units, thresholds, color schemes, and better legends.
- Used Grafana transformations to simplify query logic and add summaries.

### 📚 Milestone 4: Documentation & Enhancements
- Created a migration guide with upgrade steps and dashboard organization structure.
- Integrated **Grot** for AI-powered dashboard guidance.
- Proposed “Generate Summary” and dynamic panel reordering features using Grafana transformations.
